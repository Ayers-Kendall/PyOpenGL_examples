# Learn OpenGL in Python

Source codes partially based off AtiByte's "OpenGL in python" youtube tutorials

models_vectors_camera.py is my example for using multiple shaders, importing .objs with texture, 
and creating geometry with color data in the vertex buffer object (VBO)

## Requirements

    pip install -r requirements.txt
